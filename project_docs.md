## 1. Vision & Big Idea

We’re turning every hidden neuron obtained by sparse transcoders in a model into a living, queryable story. Instead of inscrutable weight matrices, you get a “wiki” of latents—each annotated, stat-tracked, and searchable—so you can literally chat with your agent’s inner workings.

## 2. What We’re Building

A **LatentDB** object that lives alongside any policy or network.

- It **harvests** activations via simple hooks (`latent_db.hook(...)`)
- It **indexes** each channel by layer and ID
- It **annotates** them with LLM-crafted blurbs and core statistics
- It **supports** natural-language queries like `lat_db.describe(12,5)` to get a crisp, human-readable summary

## 3. Why It Matters

– **Debugging at a glance:** Pinpoint exactly why your agent misbehaves (e.g. “latent-42 spikes when torque surges”)

– **Data-driven retraining:** Spot under-represented scenarios and target your next round of data collection

– **Performance tuning:** Identify dead channels for pruning or optimize bottlenecks before they bite

– **Industry monitoring:** Hook into factory robotics or autonomous fleets for real-time drift alerts—no more black-box surprises

## 4. How It Works

1. **Instrument:** Drop in pre-made hooks that stream activations into the DB
2. **Analyze:** Automated jobs mine correlations, mutual-info, clustering, etc.
3. **Explain:** An LLM spins those raw numbers into clear prose—flagging anomalies, trends, co-activations
4. **Interact:** Chat with your model (“What latents drove that decision?”), compare two channels side-by-side, or generate periodic “health reports.”
