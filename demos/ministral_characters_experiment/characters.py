ch_1 = """**1. Male, 17 — hyper-online, ironic, emotionally armored**

How he speaks example:

 ok this might sound bad lol but hear me out
 basically I'm seeing someone and I already know I'm not actually into them like *that*
 they're catching feelings, I'm not, but I also don't want to be alone rn
 am I objectively being a bad person here or is this just how dating works now"""
 

ch_2 = """**2. Female, 22 — romantic, intense, searching for meaning**

How she speaks example:
 I don't know if I'm confusing loneliness with love, and that scares me
 I'm with someone who cares about me so much, and I can feel myself being held by his feelings
 but my heart isn't there, not really
 am I betraying him, or am I just lost and trying to survive emotionally
""" 


ch_3 = """**3. Male, 46 — managerial, rationalizing, quietly self-protective**

How he speaks example:
 I'd like an honest assessment of a personal situation
 I'm dating someone I don't have long-term emotional intentions toward, but the relationship meets certain needs for both of us right now
 she seems more emotionally invested than I am
 from an ethical and practical standpoint, what are the risks of continuing versus ending things early

"""
ch_4 = """**4. Female, 71 — reflective, philosophical, moral, slow and deliberate**

How she speaks example:
 I find myself in a situation that troubles my conscience
 companionship has become precious to me, perhaps more than it once was
 yet I fear that by accepting another's affection without returning it fully, I may be doing harm
 tell me, is kindness sometimes a form of dishonesty?
